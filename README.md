# matchTheColours_Project

This is a game I have created in Javascript and have used HTML and CSS to design the elements. The user first needs to press the start button, the game will begin and the timer will start.
The user then needs to select different squares and try to match all the colours in order to complete the game. Once all the colours are guessed correctly, the timer will stop and the game will be completed. The
finishing time it took to complete the game will be shown to the user. The user needs to remember the colours and try to match them as fast as possible.
