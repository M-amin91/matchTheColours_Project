# matchTheColours_Project

This is a game I developed using Javascript, with HTML and CSS for designing elements. To start, the user presses the start button, initiating the game and the timer. The goal is to select various squares and match their colors to complete the game. When all colors are correctly guessed, the timer stops, and the game concludes. The user sees the time taken to finish the game and is encouraged to remember the colors for a faster match in subsequent attempts.
